# React Café Feedback App
This is a feedback widget for a café, where users can leave reviews on the service. There are three options for feedback: good, neutral, and bad. Users can select one of the options and see the updated statistics immediately.

The app is built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, using CSS Modules for styling. Modern best practices, type safety, and clean architecture are applied throughout the project.
